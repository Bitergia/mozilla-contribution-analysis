    "## Summary\n",
    "Mozilla is interested in getting better understanding the current state of its volunteer\n",
    "contributors, contributions, communities, and their connection to one another. Mozilla has\n",
    "accumulated a substantial amount of data over the years (and will be generating some more\n",
    "through a Community Census it is been undertaken in parallel to this work), but it\n",
    "hasn’t been analyzed in any significant or rigorous way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "The scope of this project is to analyze and explore data already available in the [Mozilla Analytics\n",
    "Dashobard](http://analytics.mozilla.community) (including the database that supports it), related to the following areas:\n",
    "* Understanding the people. Characterization of the community from several points of view, including “age” (time contributing) in the project, history (different kinds of contributions), migration between Mozilla projects, affiliation (Mozilla employees or independent volunteers), gender (based on a name analysis), geographical distribution (based on time zone data and GitHub data, when available), performance, etc.\n",
    "* Understanding activity. Characterization of activity in the different Mozilla projects, including evolution of activity over time, key performance factors, key good practices in specific projects, in the context of the groups characterized in the previous item. \n",
    "* Understanding interconnection. Learning how contributors work with each other in common projects, how they migrate together (or not), how they evolve, and learning about the key people acting as “connectors” between projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis proposed in this document is limited to data available for retrieval from the following data sources:\n",
    "* Git\n",
    "* GitHub\n",
    "* Bugzilla\n",
    "* Mailing Lists\n",
    "* Discourse\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, all metrics based on affiliations will depend on the quality of affiliation data provided by the Mozilla.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "To get focus in the questions that might be really interesting for Mozilla, Bitergia will use [Goals – Question – Metrics (GQM) methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQM), based on:\n",
    "1. A set of interviews or meetings with Mozilla staff to understand the pursued goals and define them together.\n",
    "2. A set of questions that might help answering if the set of goals previously defined are reached or not, or how the organization is pursuing them.\n",
    "3. A set of metrics of metrics that provide facts based on data to answer the previous questions."
