    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the interest by Mozilla of better understanding the current state of the Mozilla community, Bitergia is producing this report with the help and feedback from several people from Mozilla (see Contribution section below).\n",
    "\n",
    "This report will introduce some general issues about the analysis and its results, and then will provide specific sections for each goal, which will be refined in questions and metrics, with the corresponding analysis, as the project progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report is work in progress, until stated otherwise, and could contain errors and unverified data. Feedback and bug reports are welcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to contribute to this report, by reporting a bug, by proposing some new idea, by fixing and/or improving any part of it, or otherwise, please:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If it is a report, please open an issue on this repository.\n",
    "* If it is some proposal for a change, please submit a pull request on this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of this project is to analyze and explore data already available in the [Mozilla Analytics Dashobard](http://analytics.mozilla.community) (including the database that supports it), related to the following areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understanding people. Characterization of the community from several points of view, including “age” (time contributing) in the project, history (different kinds of contributions), migration between Mozilla projects, affiliation (Mozilla employees or independent volunteers), gender (based on a name analysis), geographical distribution (based on time zone data and GitHub data, when available), performance, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understanding activity. Characterization of activity in the different Mozilla projects, including evolution of activity over time, key performance factors, key good practices in specific projects, in the context of the groups characterized in the previous item. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Understanding interconnection. Learning how contributors work with each other in common projects, how they migrate together (or not), how they evolve, and learning about the key people acting as “connectors” between projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis uses public data, available for retrieval from the following data sources of the Mozilla community:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Git\n",
    "* GitHub (including issues and pull requests)\n",
    "* Bugzilla\n",
    "* Mailing Lists\n",
    "* Discourse\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytics based on affiliation (mapping of persons to supporting organizations) depend on the quality of affiliation data in the Mozilla Analytics Dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other interesting data sources that could be considered in the future (but are not the subject of this study, except that is specifically agreed during the exectution of this project) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mozilla Developers Network, as a data source for affiliation information\n",
    "* Forums (Kitsune), as a data source for likely first contributions by future developers\n",
    "\n",
    "The final deliverables of this project will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Jupyter notebook, with the results of the project, including code to analyze the relevant data.\n",
    "* If convenient, a PDF summary of results.\n",
    "* If agreed, some panels in the Mozilla Analytics Dashboard, for specific metrics produced by this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "To get focus in the questions that might be really interesting for Mozilla, Bitergia will use [Goals – Question – Metrics (GQM) methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQM), based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A set of interviews or meetings with Mozilla staff to understand the pursued goals and define them together.\n",
    "2. A set of questions that might help answering if the set of goals previously defined are reached or not, or how the organization is pursuing them.\n",
    "3. A set of metrics of metrics that provide facts based on data to answer the previous questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics will be derived from data already collected for the Mozilla Analytics Dashboard, stored in a ElasticSearch database in the form of raw indexes (information obtained directly from data sources, usually with all the details found in the corresponding data source), or enriched indexes (summary of relevant information, prepared to be shown by the dashboard).\n",
    "\n",
    "The process will be iterative, so that once some metrics are derived from a first goal-questions iteration, it will be discussed with Mozilla, to maybe refine the goal and questions, for subsequent refinement of the metrics. Once metrics are finally defined and obtained, analysis of the results will also be included in the report."

    "## Data still needed for producing the analysis\n",

    "To produce the analysis, and to refine some questions and metrics, some details are needed. This section includes information on the missing data or details that are still to be provided. This is an open list and may grow or shrink as the project progresses or details are provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Details on how code review is done, both in GitHub and Bugzilla, by Mozilla. In both cases, documents describing recommendations to developers on how to perform code review, or similar, would be useful. In the specific case of Bugzilla, ways of determining that an specific ticket is devoted to code review, and how it is done, are needed.\n",
    "* Details for tracking `Good first bug` tickets in GitHub and Bugzilla (tags, or whatever).\n",
    "* Repository list per project across data sources. This data could maybe used to improve the Mozilla Analytics Dashboard as well. For this, Bitergia will provide the current list of repositories, as used for the data retrieval of the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Known limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some limitations to the results of the analysis that are worth mentioning:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The structure in projects, and the affiliation information, will be as good as can be defined with the help of the Mozilla community.\n",
    "* Gender is estimated, starting from contributors name, using genderize.io API. Thereforee accuracy depends on this API, and the fact that gender is estimated based on name.\n",
    "* Time zone analysis is limited by its characteristics. On the one hand, the same time zone includes several large geographical areas (eg, larg parts of Europe and Africa are in the same timezone). On the other hand, the identification of time zones depends on user system configuration, so for some cases it may not be accurate.\n",
    "* City names, when obtained from GitHub profiles, we will be limited by the availability and reliability of this information, which is dependent on developers."
